# DayStarter
**Gotta start days with less pain**

Daystarter will try to provide an RSS feed and several morning wake up calls and agreeable songs and videos for when you wake up.

It's designed to be used mainly in that fork between sleeping and getting at work, waking up, breakfast, and commuting.

Daystarter will in time allow usage of Youtube videos, Soundcloud and Spotify support, and perhaps more if requested.

It will either provide you daily songs you've liked or chosen yourself as your wake up songs, or it will display your daily subscription feed.

At the same time, Daystarter can be provided with RSS feed addresses, and it will provide appropriate description and links in return. Any website with RSS can be added and proper news and links will be displayed back.
